BME598 Final Project - Xively data read/writer iOS app


This is a class project for BME598, designing a simple incubator.  
The incubator is an arduino board with heat/cooling and temperature/humidity sensing.  
The arduino board logs temperature and humidity readings to Xively, and it also reads desired temperature settings.
This iOS app reads the temperature/humidity readings and presents them with core plot, and allows a user to set a desired temperature.
